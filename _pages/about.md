Welcome!

My name is Boahemaa Adu-Oppong and I am currently a PhD student in the [Evolution, Ecology and Population Biology program at Washington Univresity in St. Louis](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/eepb/Pages/default.aspx). I am conducting my thesis in [Gautam Dantas' lab](http://www.dantaslab.org/) an Associate Professor at Washington University School of Medicine. I work on understanding how microbial communities are assembled and how their compositions can affect the phenotype of their host. 

Besides lab work, I love engaging with the St. Louis community by volunteering time conducting hands on science demonstrations with K-12 students. I have been involved with [The Young Scientist Program](http://ysp.wustl.edu) which is a graduate student ran organization devoted to increasing diversity in STEM.
