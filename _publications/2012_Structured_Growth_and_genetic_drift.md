excerpt: 'One condition for the evolution of altruism is genetic relatedness between altruist
and beneficiary, often achieved through active kin recognition. Here, we investigate the
power of a passive process resulting from genetic drift during population growth in the social
amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum.</i>'
